10. Application Status: Status of the application on the bridge device - Normal: Normal, Error: Error, -: No report
11. Camera RTSP Status : Status of RTSPs connected to the bridge device - Normal : Normal, Error : If any of the RTSPs is abnormal, - : No report
   - If the RTSP status is Error, it is likely that there is a problem with the RTSP connection and it is disconnected.

### Self-Check Result View
<img width="1218" alt="Devices SelfCheckResult" src="https://github.com/Scenerainc/Documentation-Website/assets/160102817/1d7b60c9-033a-41ae-9da2-dc2928c64fac">

   Note:
      - Self-Check is an additional function to identify problematic components (bridge devices, data pipelines, etc.) in the entire system, discover the cause, and take action efficiently by preparing a video with 100% guaranteed event detection in advance and sending the video to the bridge device -> Algorithm Server -> Data Pipeline -> BSS to check whether an alarm occurs at the end.
      - Depending on the event (Intrusion, Loitering ..), it may not go through both AI Server (BD) and AI Server (Pipeline) steps, only one step, or both steps. An event with a Diagnosis Result of '-' means that it does not go through that step.
      - Diagnosis Result : Success - Diagnosis success, Fail - Diagnosis failure
