## Events
The Events widget provides users with high-level data points regarding event status, enabling them to quickly understand the number of events that have been viewed/unviewed and resolved/unresolved.
![BSS-MainMenu-HomeEvents](https://github.com/Scenerainc/Documentation-Website/assets/160102817/cdae49ed-bb4b-4bc9-b651-ced0ba50a868)

- **Total** represents total number of events.
- **Unviewed** represents total number of events that has not been viewed.
- **Viewed** represents total number of events that has been viewed.
- **Resolved** represents total number of events that has been viewed and resolved.

## Events List
The Event List provides users with a simplified, detailed view of all events, offering quick insights into the what, where, when, and how of each occurrence and its triggers.
![BSS-MainMenu-EventLists](https://github.com/Scenerainc/Documentation-Website/assets/160102817/3d65f15b-9be8-4cdf-b6bb-0ce93fbcdd96)

- **Category**: Indicates the severity level of the event, categorized as caution, urgent/emergency, or warning.
- **Status**: Shows the current status of the event, whether it has been viewed, unresolved, or resolved.
- **Center** **Name**: Specifies the name of the warehouse, center, or campus where the event occurred.
- **Building** **Name**: Provides the exact name or description of the building where the event took place.
- **Camera**: Identifies the individual camera location and position within each building that captured the event.
- **Event** **Name**: Describes the type of action or use case associated with the event, as set by the user group.
- **Detected** **Date**: Indicates the date and time when the event was initially detected by the system.
- **Identified** **Date**: Shows the date and time when the event was viewed or identified by the user.
- **Resolved** **Date**: Specifies the date and time when the event was marked as resolved by the user or system.

## Processed State
The processed state widget can be tailored to suit your specific preferences and needs. Here's an example:
![BSS-MainMenu-HomeProcessed](https://github.com/Scenerainc/Documentation-Website/assets/160102817/a88593c2-18bd-49e9-842a-634e370c7fd4)

- **Processed** **Rate**: The processed rate displayed in the widget represents the percentage of events that have been identified and resolved.
This metric indicates the efficiency and effectiveness of your event resolution process.
- **Unprocessed** **Rate**: Conversely, the unprocessed rate reflects the percentage of events that have not yet been resolved. Monitoring this metric helps you track the backlog of unresolved events and prioritize accordingly.
- Other metrics could include Avg. Resolved Rate, Avg. Response Time, Escalation Rate, etc.

## Home Filter
The filter feature allows users to refine the main dashboard by various criteria including building, detection time, categories, status, and registered date. This functionality enables users to customize their dashboard view, focusing on specific parameters to better analyze and manage the displayed data.

- **Building** **Filter**: Allows users to filter events based on the specific building or location where they occurred. Users can select from a list of available buildings or enter a building name to narrow down the events displayed.
- **Detection** **Time** **Filter**: Enables users to filter events based on the time they were detected or identified. Users can specify a date range or time period to view events detected within that timeframe.
- **Category** **Filter**: Provides users with the ability to filter events based on predefined categories or types. Users can select from a list of categories such as caution, urgent/emergency, or warning to focus on specific types of events.
- **Status** **Filter**: Allows users to filter events based on their current status, such as viewed, unviewed, unresolved, or resolved. Users can choose to view events with a particular status or combination of statuses to track their progress.
